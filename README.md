Jeopardy Theme Music
--------------------

As the Jeopardy theme music is probably protected (as is the trade mark, most likely :worried:), we do not include the Jeopardy theme music in this project. We do however support playing it back if it happens to lie around as `src/main/resources/com/nerdinand/jeopardy/media/jeopardy.mp3` in your source tree... :wink:
